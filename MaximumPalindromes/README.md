This function computes the number of palindromic permutations of any substring of a given string s, modulo

+7. It first precomputes prefix frequency counts for all characters and factorials with their modular inverses to efficiently handle combinations. For a query on substring [l, r], it counts the occurrences of each character, determines how many can go in the first half of a palindrome, and tracks letters with odd counts that could occupy the center. Using factorials and modular arithmetic, it calculates the number of ways to arrange the first half and multiplies by the number of odd-count letters if needed. The result is the total number of distinct palindromic arrangements of that substring.
