This function determines the minimum number of radio transmitters needed to cover all houses in a town. It first sorts the house positions and then places transmitters strategically to cover as many houses as possible within the given range k. The function moves through the sorted list, finds the best spot to place each transmitter, and skips all houses already covered by it. This process repeats until all houses are within range of at least one transmitter, and the total number of transmitters used is returned.
