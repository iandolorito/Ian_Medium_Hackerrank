This function calculates the number of ways to build a stable wall of size n Ã— m using Lego blocks of lengths 1 to 4. It first computes rowWays, the number of ways to build a single row of width i, using dynamic programming by summing the ways to extend smaller rows with blocks of size 1 to 4. Then it computes total[i] as the total ways to stack n rows of width i without considering stability. Finally, it calculates stable[i], the number of ways to build a wall of width i with no vertical cracks running through all rows, by subtracting configurations that create unstable walls. The function returns the number of stable walls for width m.
