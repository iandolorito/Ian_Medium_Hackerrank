This function determines the winner of a permutation game where players take turns removing one element from an array, and the player who leaves the array sorted in ascending order loses. It uses recursion with memoization (memo) to avoid recalculating results for the same array configuration. The helper canWin checks if the current player can force a win: if removing any element results in a position where the next player cannot win, the current player wins. Finally, it returns "Alice" if the first player can guarantee a win, or "Bob" otherwise.
