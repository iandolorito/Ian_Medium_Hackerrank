This function calculates the sum of all possible numeric substrings of a given number n modulo 
10
9
+
7
10
9
+7. It converts the number to a string and iterates from right to left. For each digit, it computes its contribution to all substrings it appears in using a running multiplier that accounts for place value and frequency, and adds it to the total sumOfDigits. The result is the sum of all substrings of n without generating them explicitly.
