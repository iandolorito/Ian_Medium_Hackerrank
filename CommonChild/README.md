This function finds the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two strings, s1 and s2. A common subsequence is a sequence of characters that appears in both strings in the same order, though not necessarily consecutively. The function uses dynamic programming by creating a 2D array dp, where each cell dp[i][j] stores the length of the LCS between the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2. It fills the table by checking if the current characters match â€” if they do, it adds one to the previous diagonal value; otherwise, it takes the maximum of the top or left cell. Finally, it returns dp[n][m], which represents the length of the longest common subsequence between the two full strings.
