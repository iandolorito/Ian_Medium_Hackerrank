This function implements a variation of the counting sort algorithm that sorts string pairs based on numeric keys while following a specific display rule. The input arr contains pairs where each element has a number and a string. It first creates 100 buckets (arrays) to hold strings grouped by their numeric keys. For the first half of the input, it replaces strings with a dash ("-") as per the problemâ€™s requirement, while the second half keeps the original strings. After placing all elements into their respective buckets, it flattens the buckets into a single array and prints all the values in order, separated by spaces.
