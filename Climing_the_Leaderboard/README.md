This function determines a player's rank on a leaderboard after each new score. The array ranked contains the existing leaderboard scores (which may include duplicates), and player contains the playerâ€™s scores in the order they are achieved. First, it removes duplicate scores from ranked to get unique rankings. Then, for each player score, it compares it from the bottom of the leaderboard upwards to find the correct rank position. As scores increase, the index moves upward, and the rank is calculated as index + 2 since ranks start at 1. Finally, the function returns an array showing the player's rank after each game.
