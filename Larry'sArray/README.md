This function determines whether Larry’s array can be sorted using a series of 3-element rotations. It counts the number of inversions in the array — pairs of elements where a larger number appears before a smaller one. If the total number of inversions (count) is even, the array can be sorted using rotations, so it returns "YES". If the inversion count is odd, sorting is impossible with the allowed operations, so it returns "NO".
