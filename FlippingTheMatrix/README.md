This function determines the winner of the Gaming Array game played between Bob and Andy. The game starts with an array of numbers, and players take turns removing elements. On each turn, the player removes the largest number and all elements to its right. Bob always goes first. The function keeps track of how many times a new maximum value appears while iterating through the array — each new maximum represents a move. If the total number of moves is odd, Bob wins; if it’s even, Andy wins. The function then returns either "BOB" or "ANDY" based on the result.
