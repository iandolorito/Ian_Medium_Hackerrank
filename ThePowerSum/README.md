This function calculates the number of ways to express X as the sum of unique natural numbers raised to the power N. It uses a recursive helper countWays that tries two options at each step: include the current base raised to N in the sum or skip it. If including it exactly reaches X, it counts as one valid way; if it exceeds X, it returns zero. The recursion explores all combinations of increasing natural numbers, and the function returns the total count of valid sums.
