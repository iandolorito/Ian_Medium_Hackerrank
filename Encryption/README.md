This function encrypts a given string using a grid-based transposition method. It first removes all spaces from the input s, then calculates the grid dimensions based on the square root of the string’s length — using row and col to represent the number of rows and columns. If the grid isn’t large enough to fit all characters, it increases the row count by one. The function then constructs the encrypted message by reading characters column by column instead of row by row, grouping each column’s characters into a new string. Finally, it joins these column strings with spaces and returns the encrypted result.
