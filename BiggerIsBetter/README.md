This function finds the next lexicographically greater word that can be formed using the same set of letters as the input string w. It works by finding the first character from the right that can be swapped to create a larger word. If no such character exists, it means the word is already the highest possible arrangement, and it returns “no answer.” Otherwise, it swaps that character with the smallest character on its right that is larger than it, then reverses the order of the characters after the swapped position to make the next smallest possible word. Finally, it joins the letters back into a string and returns the result.
