This function checks whether a smaller grid P exists as a subgrid within a larger grid G. It iterates over all possible starting positions in G where P could fit. At each position, it first checks if the first row of P matches the corresponding substring in G. If it does, it verifies that all subsequent rows of P match the corresponding rows in G. If all rows match, it returns "YES"; if no match is found after checking all positions, it returns "NO".
