This function calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to make an array “beautiful”, meaning either sorted in ascending or descending order. It works by defining a helper countSwaps, which counts swaps required to transform the array into a given sorted version. The function uses a Map to track each element’s current index for fast swapping. For each position, if the element is not in its correct place, it swaps it with the correct element and updates the map. Finally, it computes swaps needed for both ascending and descending order and returns the smaller of the two.
