This function counts the number of unordered anagrammatic pairs of substrings in a string s. It iterates over all possible substrings, sorts the characters in each substring (so anagrams become identical), and uses a map to track how many times each sorted substring has appeared. For each substring, it adds the current count of that sorted version to the total, then increments the map. The function returns the total number of anagrammatic pairs.
