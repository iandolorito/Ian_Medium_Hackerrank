This function generates an absolute permutation of numbers from 1 to n based on a given value k. An absolute permutation means that for each position i, the absolute difference between the number placed there and i must be exactly k. If k is zero, the function simply returns a sequence from 1 to n. If n cannot be evenly divided into groups of size 2k, itâ€™s impossible to form such a permutation, so it returns [-1]. Otherwise, it alternates between adding and subtracting k from each index to build the valid permutation pattern and returns the resulting array.
