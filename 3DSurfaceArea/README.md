This function calculates the total surface area of a 3D shape formed by stacking cubes on a 2D grid. Each element in the array A represents the height of stacked cubes at that position. The function loops through each cell and adds the top and bottom surfaces (2 units). Then, it compares the current height with its neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right) to find any exposed sides. For each side that is higher than its neighbor, the uncovered part contributes to the surface area. Finally, the function returns the total surface area of the entire 3D structure.
