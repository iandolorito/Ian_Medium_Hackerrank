This function solves the Red John problem, which counts the number of prime numbers in the ways a wall of length n can be built using 1×1 and 4×1 bricks. First, countWays(n) uses dynamic programming to compute how many ways the wall can be built: either adding a 1×1 brick or a 4×1 brick at each step. Then, it iterates through all numbers from 2 up to the total number of ways, counting how many are prime using isPrime. The function returns this count of prime numbers.
