This function calculates the minimum number of candies needed to distribute among children based on their ratings. Each child must receive at least one candy, and children with higher ratings than their immediate neighbors must get more candies. The function first assigns one candy to everyone, then makes a left-to-right pass to ensure that any child rated higher than the one before gets more candies. Next, it makes a right-to-left pass to adjust cases where a child has a higher rating than the next one but doesnâ€™t yet have more candies. Finally, it sums up all candies and returns the total minimum number required.
