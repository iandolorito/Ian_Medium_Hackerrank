This function finds the maximum product of areas of two non-overlapping plus shapes that can be formed on a grid. Each cell in the grid is either 'G' (good) or 'B' (bad), and a plus can only be built using 'G' cells. The helper function sizeOfPlus determines the largest possible size of a plus centered at a given cell by expanding equally in all four directions while staying within 'G' cells. The program then generates all possible pluses of every size and stores the grid positions they occupy. Finally, it compares every pair of pluses, skipping those that overlap, and calculates the product of their areas (the number of cells covered). The function returns the maximum product found among all valid combinations.
