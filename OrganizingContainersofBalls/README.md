This function determines whether it is possible to organize containers such that each container holds balls of only one type. It calculates the total number of balls in each container (rowSum) and the total number of balls of each type across all containers (colSum). By sorting and comparing these totals, the function checks if each container’s capacity can exactly match a ball type’s total count. If every total matches, it returns "Possible"; otherwise, it returns "Impossible".
