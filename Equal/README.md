This function calculates the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in an array equal, where in each operation you can reduce any element by 1, 2, or 5. It starts by finding the smallest value in the array and then tests several possible target values slightly below it (up to 4 less) since lowering the base value can sometimes lead to fewer moves overall. For each possible base, it computes how many operations are required to reduce every number to that level by using the largest possible reductions first (5s, then 2s, then 1s). The function keeps track of the smallest total number of moves among all bases and returns that as the minimum number of operations needed.
