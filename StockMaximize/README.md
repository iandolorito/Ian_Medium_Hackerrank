This function calculates the maximum profit from stock trading where you can buy any number of stocks each day and sell them later. It iterates backward through the prices array, keeping track of the maximum future price (maxPrice). For each day, if the current price is less than maxPrice, it “buys” the stock and adds the difference to profit; if the current price is higher, it updates maxPrice. The function returns the total profit achievable by always buying at lower prices and selling at the next peak.
