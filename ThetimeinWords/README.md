This function converts a given time in hours h and minutes m into words as commonly spoken in English. It uses an array w to map numbers to words. Special cases like “o’ clock”, “quarter past”, “half past”, and “quarter to” are handled explicitly. For other minutes, it expresses the time as “x minutes past h” if m < 30, or “x minutes to h+1” if m > 30, adjusting for singular and plural forms of “minute”. The function returns the time as a readable English phrase.
