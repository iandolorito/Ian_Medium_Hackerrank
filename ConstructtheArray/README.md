This function counts the number of valid arrays of length n that can be formed using numbers from 1 to k, with the condition that the first element is always 1 and the last element must be x, while no two adjacent elements can be the same. It uses dynamic programming with two variables: a (arrays ending with 1) and b (arrays ending with any number other than 1). For each position, it updates a and b based on the previous counts, ensuring no identical adjacent elements. The result is computed modulo 1,000,000,007 to handle large numbers. Finally, it returns a if the last number is 1, or b if itâ€™s any other number.
