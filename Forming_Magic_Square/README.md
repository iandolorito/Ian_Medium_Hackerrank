This function calculates the minimum cost to convert a given 3×3 matrix into a magic square, where each row, column, and diagonal sums to 15 using the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once. It first defines all eight possible 3×3 magic squares. For each of these, the function computes a cost — the total of the absolute differences between each element in the given matrix s and the corresponding element in the magic square. It keeps track of the smallest cost found across all possibilities. Finally, it returns minCost, which represents the minimum number of changes needed to transform the input square into a valid magic square.
