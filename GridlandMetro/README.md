This function calculates the number of unoccupied cells in a grid after placing train tracks. It first groups all the track segments by their row number, then sorts and merges any overlapping or adjacent segments within the same row to avoid counting them twice. After merging, it calculates the total number of grid cells covered by tracks and subtracts that from the total number of cells in the grid (n Ã— m). The result, returned as a BigInt, represents the number of empty cells that are not occupied by any train track.
