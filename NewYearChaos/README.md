This function calculates the minimum number of bribes that occurred in a queue based on its final state, or prints "Too chaotic" if someone has moved more than two positions forward. It iterates through the queue, and for each person, it checks if they have moved more than two positions aheadâ€”if so, the situation is impossible. Otherwise, it counts how many people with higher numbers are in front of them within a possible bribe range, summing these to get the total number of bribes.
