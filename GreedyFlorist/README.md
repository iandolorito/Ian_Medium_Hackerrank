This function calculates the minimum total cost of buying flowers when k friends are purchasing from a list of flower prices c. Each time a person buys another flower, the price they pay for it increases by a multiplier based on how many flowers theyâ€™ve already bought. To minimize the total cost, the function first sorts the prices in descending order so the most expensive flowers are bought first. Then, for each flower, it multiplies its price by (Math.floor(i / k) + 1), which represents how many times that buyer has already made a purchase. Finally, it sums up all the adjusted costs and returns the minimum total cost needed to buy all flowers.
