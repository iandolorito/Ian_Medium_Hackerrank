This function simulates a game where a player jumps on clouds in a circular path. Starting with 100 energy, the player jumps k steps at a time through the array c, where each element represents a cloud â€” 0 for normal and 1 for thundercloud. Each jump reduces energy by 1, but landing on a thundercloud costs 3 energy instead. The process continues until the player returns to the starting point, and the function returns the remaining energy after completing the loop.
