This function checks whether a given array can be sorted by performing at most one simple operation — either swapping two elements or reversing one continuous subarray. It first creates a sorted copy of the array and identifies the indices where the original and sorted arrays differ. If there are no differences, the array is already sorted. If there are exactly two differences, a single swap will sort it. Otherwise, the function tests whether reversing the segment between the first and last mismatched positions results in a sorted array. Depending on the outcome, it prints “yes” (with the operation type and indices) or “no” if it’s not possible.
