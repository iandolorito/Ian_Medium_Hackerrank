This function finds the minimum “unfairness” when selecting k elements from an array, where unfairness is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest selected numbers. It first sorts the array in ascending order, then slides a window of size k across the sorted array, calculating the difference between the first and last elements of each window. The smallest such difference across all windows is returned as the minimum unfairness.
