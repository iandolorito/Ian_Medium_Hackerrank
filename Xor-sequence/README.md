This function computes the XOR of all numbers in the range [l, r] efficiently using properties of XOR. It defines bxor(i), which returns the XOR of all numbers from 0 to i based on the pattern that repeats every 4 numbers. Then G(n) computes the XOR from 0 to n using block-wise calculations and XORing the remaining numbers. Finally, the XOR of the range [l, r] is obtained as G(r) ^ G(l - 1), exploiting the property that a ^ a = 0 and XOR is associative.
