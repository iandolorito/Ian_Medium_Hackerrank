This function simulates the Counter Game, a two-player game played between Louise and Richard using a number n. Players take turns performing moves until the number becomes 1. If the number is a power of two, the player divides it by 2; otherwise, they subtract the largest power of two less than n. The function uses BigInt to handle very large numbers and keeps track of turns using the variable turn, which switches after each move. When the game ends (i.e., n becomes 1), the function checks who made the last move and returns "Louise" if she won or "Richard" otherwise.
