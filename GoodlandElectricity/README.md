This function determines the minimum number of power plants needed to supply electricity to all cities in a row, given the placement constraints. Each element in arr represents a city â€” 1 means a power plant can be built there, and 0 means it cannot. The parameter k specifies the range a power plant can cover to the left and right. The function moves along the array, always placing a plant at the farthest possible city within range (i + k - 1) that can host one (arr[loc] === 1). If no valid location is found within the range, it returns -1 since it's impossible to power all cities. Otherwise, it counts the number of plants built and returns that total once all cities are covered.
