This function determines how many notifications should be sent based on unusual spending activity over a given period. It tracks daily expenditures and compares each day’s spending to twice the median of the previous d days. The helper function getMedian() efficiently finds the median using a frequency array (count) that keeps track of spending amounts (ranging from 0 to 200). For each new day after the first d, it checks if the current day’s expenditure is at least twice the median — if so, a notification is triggered. The oldest day’s data is then removed from the count, and the new day’s data is added. Finally, the function returns the total number of notifications generated.
