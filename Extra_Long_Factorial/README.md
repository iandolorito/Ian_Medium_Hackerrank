This function calculates and prints the factorial of a very large number using BigInt to handle values beyond normal integer limits. It first creates an array of numbers from n down to 1, then multiplies them all together using a variable total initialized as 1n (a BigInt). The multiplication is performed within a loop to compute n! (n factorial). Finally, the result is converted to a string and printed to the console to display the full factorial value without losing precision.
