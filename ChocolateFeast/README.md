This function calculates how many chocolates a person can eat given a certain amount of money and a wrapper exchange offer. The parameter n represents the total money, c is the cost of one chocolate, and m is the number of wrappers needed to get one free chocolate. The function first determines how many chocolates can be bought initially, then keeps exchanging wrappers for extra chocolates as long as there are enough wrappers. Each time an exchange happens, it updates the number of chocolates and remaining wrappers. Finally, it returns the total number of chocolates eaten, including those obtained through exchanges.
