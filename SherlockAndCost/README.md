This function calculates the maximum cost of an array B where the cost is defined as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements after choosing a value between 1 and B[i] for each element. It uses dynamic programming with two states: low (choosing 1 for the previous element) and high (choosing B[i-1]). At each step, it updates these states based on the maximum possible cost if the next element is either 1 or B[i]. Finally, it returns the maximum achievable cost for the entire array.
