This function checks whether a string s is a “valid” string according to Sherlock’s rules: a string is valid if all characters appear the same number of times, or if it is possible to remove just one character to achieve that. It first counts the frequency of each character and then counts how many characters have each frequency. If there is only one frequency, it returns "YES". If there are more than two frequencies, it returns "NO". If there are exactly two frequencies, it checks if removing one occurrence of a character (either a single character with frequency 1, or reducing the higher frequency by 1) would make all frequencies equal, returning "YES" if so, otherwise "NO".
