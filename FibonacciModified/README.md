This function calculates a modified Fibonacci sequence where each term is defined as T(n) = T(n-2) + (T(n-1))Â². It starts with the given initial values t1 and t2, converting them to BigInt to handle very large numbers. The loop runs from the third term up to n, repeatedly updating the previous two terms (a and b) using the modified formula. After completing the loop, it returns the nth term of the sequence as a string to ensure the large result can be properly displayed without precision loss.
