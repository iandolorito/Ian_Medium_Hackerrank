This function solves the Unbounded Knapsack problem, where you can use each item value from arr multiple times without limit to get as close as possible to a total weight k without exceeding it. It uses dynamic programming (dp) where dp[w] stores the best total value achievable with capacity w. For each item in arr, it iterates through possible weights from that item’s value up to k, updating dp[w] with the maximum between the current value and the value of using that item again (dp[w - arr[i]] + arr[i]). In the end, it returns dp[k], which is the maximum total sum ≤ k.
